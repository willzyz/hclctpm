  abstract={Abstract Prior research involving promotional response models has largely overlooked the impact of time limits on customer response. We address this issue by developing a price-promotion model in which time limits are conceptualized not only in terms of their effects on customer awareness but also customer urgency. Further, the proposed model incorporates recent insights from behavioral research which indicates that time limits can either enhance or diminish the effects of discount incentives. A key advantage of our approach is that it places minimal demands on managers’ resources, while also leveraging their unique knowledge of the market. In collaboration with an online retailer who frequently uses price promotions, we examine a real-world promotion and illustrate the insights facilitated by the model. In this empirical context, urgency declines with longer time limits but it does so less steeply when accompanied by larger discounts. Additionally, the managers learned that they tend to use time limits that are too long and discounts that are too small, resulting in foregone profits. We conclude by demonstrating the value of sensitivity analyses for understanding how profits can vary with changes in the environment and with differences in the accuracy of managers’ knowledge about customer responsiveness.},

 abstract = {When evaluating the efficacy of social programs and medical treatments using randomized experiments, the estimated overall average causal effect alone is often of limited value and the researchers must investigate when the treatments do and do not work. Indeed, the estimation of treatment effect heterogeneity plays an essential role in (1) selecting the most effective treatment from a large number of available treatments, (2) ascertaining subpopulations for which a treatment is effective or harmful, (3) designing individualized optimal treatment regimes, (4) testing for the existence or lack of heterogeneous treatment effects, and (5) generalizing causal effect estimates obtained from an experimental sample to a target population. In this paper, we formulate the estimation of heterogeneous treatment effects as a variable selection problem. We propose a method that adapts the Support Vector Machine classifier by placing separate sparsity constraints over the pre-treatment parameters and causal heterogeneity parameters of interest. The proposed method is motivated by and applied to two well-known randomized evaluation studies in the social sciences. Our method selects the most effective voter mobilization strategies from a large number of alternative strategies, and it also identifies the characteristics of workers who greatly benefit from (or are negatively affected by) a job training program. In our simulation studies, we find that the proposed method often outperforms some commonly used alternatives.},
